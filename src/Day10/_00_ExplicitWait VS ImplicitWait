Explicit Wait: will wait for a specific element and specific condition!
        - elementToBeClickable();
        - visibilityOfElement();


                    Implicit Wait VS Explicit Wait

        Implicit Wait:
            - Is creating one time wait for the driver and it will
              affect the driver until the driver.quit() method!
            - Handling noSuchElementException!

        Explicit Wait:
            - We'll create explicit wait for a specific element and
              when the element executed it will not affect anymore!
            - Handle the exception depends on which method we use!
