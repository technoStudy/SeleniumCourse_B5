    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
        type specimen book. <span style="background-color: yellow">It has survived</span> not only five centuries, but also
        the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged.
        <div style="background-color: red">It was popularised</div>
        in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
        Lorem Ipsum.

    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
        line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

        The red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus) is a species of venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The
        species is indigenous to Australia. Originally described by George Shaw in 1794 as a species new to science, it is
        one of eastern Australia's most commonly encountered snakes. Averaging around 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in) in length, it has
        glossy black upperparts, bright red or orange flanks, and a pink or dull red belly. It is not an aggressive species
        and generally retreats from encounters with people, but can attack if provoked. Although its venom is capable of
        causing significant illness, no deaths have been recorded from its bite, which is less venomous than other
        Australian elapid snakes. The venom contains neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants and has haemolytic properties;
        victims can also lose their sense of smell.

        Common in woodlands, forests and swamplands, the red-bellied black snake often ventures into nearby urban areas. It
        forages in bodies of shallow water, commonly with tangles of water plants and logs, where it hunts its main prey
        item, frogs, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. The snake is considered to be a least-concern species
        according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its numbers are thought to be declining due to
        habitat fragmentation and decline of frog populations.

        The red-bellied black snake has a glossy black top body with a light-grey snout and brown mouth, [24] and a
        completely black tail. It lacks a well-defined neck; its head merges seamlessly into the body.[25] Its flanks are
        bright red or orange, fading to pink or dull red on the belly. All these scales have black margins.[4] Snakes from
        northern populations tend to have lighter, more cream or pink bellies. The red-bellied black snake is on average
        around 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in) long, the largest individual recorded at 2.55 m (8 ft 4 in).[24] Males are generally
        slightly larger than females.[22] A large 2 m (6 ft 7 in) specimen caught in Newcastle has been estimated to weigh
        around 10 kg (22 lb).[26] The red-bellied black snake can have a strong smell, which some field experts have used to
        find the snakes in the wild.[27]

        Like all elapid snakes, it is proteroglyphous (front-fanged). Juveniles are similar to the eastern small-eyed snake
        (Cryptophis nigrescens), with which it can be easily confused, although the latter species lacks the red flanks.[25]
        Other similar species include the blue-bellied black snake (Pseudechis guttatus) and copperheads of the genus
        Austrelaps.[22] An early misconception was that the red-bellied black snake was sexually dimorphic, and that the
        eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) was the female form.[28] This was recognised as such by Australian
        zoologist Gerard Krefft in his 1869 work Snakes of

        The diet of red-bellied black snakes primarily consists of frogs, but they also prey on reptiles and small mammals.
        They also eat other snakes, commonly eastern brown snakes and even their own species. Fish are hunted in water.[35]
        Red-bellied black snakes may hunt on or under the water surface, and prey can be eaten underwater or brought to the
        surface. They have been recorded stirring up substrate, possibly to disturb prey.[22] As red-bellied black snakes
        grow and mature, they continue to eat the same size prey, but add larger animals, as well.[47] Although they prefer
        live food, red-bellied black snakes have been reported eating frogs squashed by cars.[48]

        They are susceptible to cane toad (Rhinella marina) toxins.[48] The introduction of cane toads in Australia dates to
        1935, when they were introduced in an attempt at biological control of native beetles, which were damaging sugarcane
        fields (a non-native plant). The intervention failed, mostly because the toads are on the ground, while the beetles
        feed on leaves at the top of the plant. One research study concluded that in less than 75 years, the red-bellied
        black snake had evolved in toad-inhabited regions of Australia to have increased resistance to toad toxin and
        decreased preference for toads as prey.[49]
